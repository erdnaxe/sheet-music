# Erdnaxe's Sheets of Music

I put arranged / rearranged sheets of music here.

This music is free and the originals are moslty extracted from IMSLP and Musescore website.

To edit the sheets you will need Musescore, which is a free software available on Linux, OS X, Windows.

## The Charleston
This sheet of music is a arrangement from : http://musescore.com/score/1356711

It was created to be played by students (2 guitars, 1 cello, 1 piano, 2 group of singer).
You don't need everyone to construct the melody, just one part can be enough.
